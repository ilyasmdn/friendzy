MVP Development Steps

    Set Up Project Structure

    First, create the base project structure:
        Frontend (React + Tailwind)
        Backend (Node.js + MySQL)

    Set Up React App with Tailwind
        Initialize the React app using Vite or Create React App.
        Install Tailwind CSS and set up the configuration for custom styles.

    Implement the Home Screen
        Create the Home screen where the user can choose between the different game modes (Truth Toss, Friendship Levels, Guess the Answer).
        Use React Router to navigate to the game modes.

    Build Game Mode Logic
        Truth Toss: Hardcode a few personal questions. Display them with a timer (e.g., 30 seconds).
        Friendship Levels: Use simple personal questions about friends (e.g., “What’s your friend’s favorite color?”).
        Guess the Answer: Hardcode some questions and answers, and add a logic to check if the user was correct.

    Backend Integration (Node.js + MySQL)
        For now, the backend can just handle user data, scores (if needed), and provide any persistent state (optional for MVP).
        Set up a basic Node.js API to handle basic requests like:
            Get random questions.
            Submit answers and calculate scores.

    Add Basic User Authentication (Optional)
        For now, you can implement simple login/signup using JWT or session-based authentication. This can be optional if you want to skip user management in the MVP.

    Styling with Tailwind CSS
        Ensure the game screen and components are clean and visually appealing.
        Use Tailwind’s utility classes for responsive design so the app works well on both desktop and mobile.

    Testing and Debugging
        Test the app to ensure basic functionality works. This includes:
            Navigating between game modes.
            Answering questions and receiving feedback.
            Running the timer.

    Deploy Backend (Free Hosting)
        Deploy the backend using free hosting services like Heroku (for Node.js) or Render.

    Deploy Frontend (Free Hosting)
        Deploy the frontend on Netlify or Vercel.

    Mobile App Using Capacitor
        Transform the web app into a mobile app using Capacitor, targeting iOS and Android.
        Start by testing the app in a browser before packaging it into the mobile app.

Key MVP Features to Focus On First

    Truth Toss Mode (hardcoded questions, timer, answer submission).
    Home Screen (simple game mode selection).
    Game flow (questions, answers, and timer).
    Basic UI (using Tailwind CSS).

Once you’ve implemented these core features, you can refine them and add additional features like the leaderboard, more game modes, or user authentication.
Post-MVP (Future Features)

    Add a database for user data and scores.
    Include more dynamic questions or user-generated content.
    Improve UI/UX with animations or advanced designs.
    Add social sharing features.
    Incorporate sound effects or music for better engagement.
