1. Define the Core Features

    Truth Toss:
        Randomized question generator with difficulty levels (e.g., Easy, Medium, Spicy).
        Option to skip/toss a question with a penalty system.
    Friendship Levels:
        Quiz-style question system where players answer questions about their friends.
        Scoring and progression system with fun badges or titles (e.g., "BFF Guru").
    Guess the Answer:
        Private answer input by one player.
        Guessing interface for others with options to select or type guesses.
        Points for accuracy or humor.

2. Plan the App Flow

    Onboarding:
        Introduce the game and explain the modes (via tutorial or animations).
        Allow users to create or join a game session with friends.
    Mode Selection:
        Players choose between Truth Toss, Friendship Levels, or Guess the Answer.
        Optionally, offer a "Mixed Mode" to rotate between games.
    Gameplay:
        Core mechanics for each mode as discussed.
    Scoring and Rewards:
        Track scores across modes.
        Award badges, unlockables, or fun titles.

3. Choose the Tech Stack

    Frontend:
        Framework: React Native (for cross-platform support).
        UI Library: TailwindCSS (if comfortable) or custom styles.
    Backend:
        Node.js with Express.js for handling game logic and APIs.
        Database: MySQL for storing user data, scores, and question sets.
    Hosting & Deployment:
        Firebase for real-time features (e.g., multiplayer synchronization).
        Cloud hosting like AWS or Heroku for the backend.

4. Design the App

    Use tools like Figma or Adobe XD to prototype:
        Color Scheme: Friendly and vibrant tones (to match the fun theme).
        Typography: Clear and playful fonts.
        Icons and Animations: Add small interactions (like spinning wheels for Truth Toss).

5. Develop MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

Focus on building a basic version of the app with:

    A single mode to test (e.g., Truth Toss).
    A simple user interface for creating and joining games.
    Real-time multiplayer or local pass-and-play functionality.

6. Test and Iterate

    Beta Testing: Involve friends or small groups to test the app.
    Feedback Loop: Gather insights and refine features based on user experience.

7. Launch and Market

    Platforms: Publish on Google Play and Apple App Store.
    Marketing: Use social media, influencers, or gamified marketing to promote.
    Monetization: Consider ads, in-app purchases (e.g., premium question packs), or subscriptions.
